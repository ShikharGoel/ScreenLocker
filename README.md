# ScreenLocker
It is an application for those who keep forgetting important passwords or ids. The application uses Graphical Password Authentication using Cued-Click Points.
In the first launch of the application, the user enters details which are going to come in handy as recovery details.
After filling in the above details, the user chooses a password by setting up click points on a sequence of images decided by user selections.
After this, the user is asked to confirm the click points.
Once the password is setup, the user can add accounts for which he/she wants to store the details for, e.g., Bank Account Numbers , credit card numbers, etc.
The user can change the password for the application as well as change the recovery details(the details entered at first time launch)
The user can view the account details stored by entering the Graphical password.
The user is given five tries in case of wrong password, otherwise he/she will need to enter recovery details.
